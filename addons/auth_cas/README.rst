==================
CAS Authentication
==================

This module allows users to login with their CAS account (often LDAP username
and password), and will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.
In Order to use it, you must have a functional CAS server already installed.


Installation
############

* Add CAS server address under Settings/General Settings

* Activate the boolean field 'CAS Activate'

* Add URL Address in cas_server

* Add URL port in cas_server_port


Configuration
#############

* After installing this module, you need to configure the CAS parameters in the default settings.
* The AS authentication only works if you are in a single database mode.
* You can launch the Odoo Server with the option --db-filter=YOUR_DATABASE to do so.

Security Considerations
#######################

Users' CAS passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the CAS server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated.
Odoo does not manage password changes in the CAS, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means.
